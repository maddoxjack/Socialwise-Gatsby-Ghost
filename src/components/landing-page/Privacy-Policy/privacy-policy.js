                    Privacy Policy socialwise.io websites (collectively
                    “socialwise.io” in this document) refer to sites hosted on
                    the socialwise.io and subdomains thereof. This privacy
                    policy describes how socialwise.io uses and protects any
                    information that you give us. We are committed to ensuring
                    that your privacy is protected. If you provide us with
                    personal information through socialwise.io, you can be
                    assured that it will only be used in accordance with this
                    privacy statement. Website Visitors Like most website
                    operators, socialwise.io collects non-personally-identifying
                    information of the sort that web browsers and servers
                    typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                    preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
                    visitor request. socialwise.io’s purpose in collecting
                    non-personally identifying information is to better
                    understand how socialwise.io’s visitors use its website.
                    From time to time, socialwise.io may release
                    non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate,
                    e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
                    website. socialwise.io also collects potentially
                    personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
                    (IP) addresses. socialwise.io does not use IP addresses to
                    identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such
                    information, other than under the same circumstances that it
                    uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as
                    described below. Gathering of Personally-Identifying
                    Information Certain visitors to socialwise.io choose to
                    interact with socialwise.io in ways that require
                    socialwise.io to gather personally-identifying information.
                    The amount and type of information that socialwise.io
                    gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For
                    example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a
                    username and email address. In each case, socialwise.io
                    collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
                    appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s
                    interaction with socialwise.io. socialwise.io does not
                    disclose personally-identifying information other than as
                    described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
                    personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it
                    may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
                    activities, like purchasing a socialwise ticket. All of the
                    information that is collected on socialwise.io will be
                    handled in accordance with GDPR legislation. Protection of
                    Certain Personally-Identifying Information socialwise.io
                    discloses potentially personally-identifying and
                    personally-identifying information only to those of project
                    administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated
                    organizations that (i) need to know that information in
                    order to process it on socialwise.io’s behalf or to provide
                    services available through socialwise.io, and (ii) that have
                    agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
                    employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
                    located outside of your home country; by using
                    socialwise.io, you consent to the transfer of such
                    information to them. socialwise.io will not rent or sell
                    potentially personally-identifying and
                    personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to
                    project administrators, employees, contractors, and
                    affiliated organizations, as described above, socialwise.io
                    discloses potentially personally-identifying and
                    personally-identifying information only when required to do
                    so by law, if you give permission to have your information
                    shared, or when socialwise.io believes in good faith that
                    disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property
                    or rights of socialwise.io, third parties, or the public at
                    large. If you are a registered user of a socialwise.io
                    website and have supplied your email address, socialwise.io
                    may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new
                    features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date
                    with what’s going on with socialwise.io and our products. We
                    primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
                    information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a
                    minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support
                    email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
                    right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond
                    to your request or to help us support other users.
                    socialwise.io takes all measures reasonably necessary to
                    protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or
                    destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
                    personally-identifying information. Use of personal
                    information We use the information you provide to register
                    for an account, attend our events, receive newsletters, use
                    certain other services, or participate in the socialwise
                    open source project in any other way. We will not sell or
                    lease your personal information to third parties unless we
                    have your permission or are required by law to do so. We
                    would like to send you email marketing communication which
                    may be of interest to you from time to time. If you have
                    consented to marketing, you may opt out later. You have a
                    right at any time to stop us from contacting you for
                    marketing purposes. If you no longer wish to be contacted
                    for marketing purposes, please click on the unsubscribe link

                    personal information We rely on one or more of the following
                    processing conditions: our legitimate interests in the

                    particular version of socialwise was downloaded or report on
